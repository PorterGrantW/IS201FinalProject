        <div class="common center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scriptures, we learn that it is by "the knowledge of [our] Redeemer 
            and the very points of His doctrine, that [we] may know how to come unto Him and be saved" (1 Nephi 15:14).
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Savior taught, "this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and 
            I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the 
            Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in 
            me. And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit 
            the kingdom of God" (3 Nephi 11:32-33). 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this and other, similar passages of scripture,
            we understand that Christ's doctrine, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the way in which we 
                accept His gift of peace, hope, and salvation,</span> is by
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Exercising faith in Him, which includes believing/trusting that:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>He genuinely has the power to right every wrong</li>
                                    <li>He will provide us with all the direction we need to choose right over wrong, regardless of how much we've
                                        failed to do so in the past.</li>
                                        
                                </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repenting, "the Greek word of which this [term] is the translation denot[ing] a change of mind, a fresh view about God, 
                            about oneself, and about the world" (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Bible Dictionary).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Being baptized, which term comes from "a Greek word meaning to 'dip' or 'immerse'" oneself in the teachings and lifestyle
                            of Jesus Christ -- a committment made through a priesthood ordinance (a sacred cerimony performed by someone holding
                            authority from God to perform such an action), which allows the individual being baptized to make lifelong covenants to 
                            trust, follow, seek to emulate, serve, and adhere to the commandments of our Heavenly Father.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Receiving the ensuing gift promised by the Lord to all those who make and keep said covenants with Him through baptism,
                            the priviledge and right to constant revelation, sanctification, and unity with God through the presence of His Spirit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Enduring to the end, deciding -- as is inherent in the aforementioned points of Christ's doctrine -- to make desires for salvation permanent, 
                            lifelong, and not a temporary endeavor. Our desire to make this choice grows as we experience the results of our faith in Christ, "the fruit 
                            of the Spirit," which "is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against [which results] there is 
                            no law" (Galatians 5:22-23) for God's laws are meant to make possible, not inhibit, the experience of these "fruits" which bring so much wonder 
                            and awe into life." This decision is made actionable as we make and keep more covenants through more ordinances, such as those
                            found in temples -- see the video and chart below for more information!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    To be saved is to become like Jesus Christ, our character and nature being changed into His. Thus, living Christ's doctrine 
                    ultimately points us to fulfill His invitation at the end of 3 Nephi 11, to "go forth unto this people, and declare the words 
                    which [He has] spoken, unto the ends of the earth," for that is what He did. In response to the question "what manner of 
                    men [and women] ought [we] to be?" He taught, "verily I say unto you, even as I am."
                    <br><br>
                    That we follow His direction is my hope and prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, so be it.
